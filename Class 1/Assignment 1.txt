1. What is web?
--> Web is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet.
-->The Web is the common name for the World Wide Web, a subset of the Internet consisting of the pages 
that can be accessed by a Web browser.


2. Internet History
--> The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, 
or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense,
ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.

    On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to 
another. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; 
each one was the size of a small house.) 
The message—“LOGIN”—was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network anyway: 
The Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters.

    ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” 
that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist 
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. While it’s often confused with the internet itself, the web is actually just
the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks. 

    The web helped popularize the internet among the public, and served as a crucial step in developing the vast trove of 
information that most of us now access on a daily basis.


3. Difference between web, website and web page
--> A website is simply interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Webpage consists of content regarding a single entity type                                           | Website constitutes content regarding several entities                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A direct URL link or a website can be used to access it                                              | A domain address is used to access it                                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A combination of webpages is created using HTML and CSS                                              | Information is in HTML language                                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| An individual hypertext document linked under a website                                              | A collection of multiple pages hosted on the server                                 |

| Stores the contents or resources that are to be displayed on a website                               | Is a place used to display the content                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Comparatively, less complex                                                                          | More complex to develop                                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Less time to develop                                                                                 | Takes more time to develop                                                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The web page address of any specific website is directly dependent on the website address (domain).  | Website address (domain) is independent of webpage address.                         |
| Webpage will not work if the domain is down                                                          | If the webpage is deleted for any reason, the website will still continue to work.  |
|                                                                                                      | All other linked webpages will also work as usual                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Examples: Contact page, Registration Page, Service Page, About Us page and so on                     | Examples: Flipkart.com, Nykaa.com, Amazon.com and more                              |

4 Web development Tools
--> Web developer tools, also called DevTools, are programs that allow professionals to create software and debug and test their code on web development projects. These tools also help individuals 
review the user interface of a web application or website. While these tools may not help developers build an application or website, they allow them to review the security and aesthetic features and 
design custom website elements. They may be available to web developers as add-ons and built-in features in web browsers. When choosing a program, professionals may consider various factors, including 
ease of use, scalability, security, functionality and cost.
